&lt;p>Today, as founder and Technical Director of &lt;a href="https://www.assoverse.com/">Assoverse&lt;/a>, i uses my multiple talents and experiences to create innovative software solutions, meeting the concrete needs of my clients, while helping to shape a technological and socially responsible future.&lt;/p>
