Welcome to my tiny blog!

Here, I plan to share ideas, projects, and random thoughts that I want to save somewhere for future reference.
It's a little corner where I can document my work process, highlight some of the small tools I create, and talk about the challenges I encounter in my business.

My goal is to keep this space both personal and informative. 
I hope you find some of the content interesting or, at the very least, useful in your own journey.

You'll notice that I’ll occasionally switch between English and French in my posts. 
Being French, I feel more comfortable expressing certain ideas in my native language. 
That said, I want to keep practicing English, even if it’s not perfect.
So, please bear with me if you come across some "franglais" moments in the text!

I’ve deliberately chosen not to rely on automatic translation tools.
Instead, I prefer writing naturally, even if it means making some mistakes along the way.
I believe it’s all part of the process.

Thanks for stopping by, and I hope you enjoy reading!

Corvus
