Welcome in my blog !

With over 8 years of experience in IT development, i embodies the passion and technical expertise at the heart of [Assoverse](https://www.assoverse.com/). Officially a developer for eight years, my journey began much earlier, at the age of 13, when i began creating software.

Known for my “mad dog” mentality in technology, i'm constantly looking for stimulating challenges, innovative solutions and disruptive ideas that can change the game. My passion for research and development is tireless, fueled by the belief that a single crazy idea can transform the world.

Today, as founder and Technical Director of [Assoverse](https://www.assoverse.com/), i uses my multiple talents and experiences to create innovative software solutions, meeting the concrete needs of my clients, while helping to shape a technological and socially responsible future.

Also i love create random software, just to help me with some repetitive things.
