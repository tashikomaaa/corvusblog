Welcome in my blog !

With over 8 years of experience in IT development, Aldwin embodies the passion and technical expertise at the heart of Assoverse. Officially a developer for eight years, his journey began much earlier, at the age of 13, when he began creating software.

Known for his “mad dog” mentality in technology, Aldwin is constantly looking for stimulating challenges, innovative solutions and disruptive ideas that can change the game. His passion for research and development is tireless, fueled by the belief that a single crazy idea can transform the world.

In addition to his technical expertise, Aldwin has significant experience in the field of street fundraising, where he worked for three consecutive years as a donor recruiter. This experience allowed him to explore the associative world in depth, to understand the challenges of fundraising and to develop essential skills in communication and public relations.

Today, as founder and Technical Director of Assoverse, Aldwin uses his multiple talents and experiences to create innovative software solutions, meeting the concrete needs of his clients, while helping to shape a technological and socially responsible future.
